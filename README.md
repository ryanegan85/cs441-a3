Assignment 3 for CS441.


Project is run through android studio/any android emulator.

Screen 1 contains 2 editable text boxes that prompt the user to insert temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius; editing one will
change the other editable text box with the correct value, as well as updating the uneditable textboxes on the top of the screen.
Using the slider will also update the values, ranging from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius.

Hitting the "Vacation!" button will bring the user to screen 2, displaying the current temperature, a picture of a vacation spot 
appropriate to that temperature, and a line of flavor text along with the picture. Hitting the "Done!" button will bring the user
back to screen 1.
